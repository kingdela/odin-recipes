            Ghanaian Jollof Rice: A legendary dish
        </h2>

        <p>
            Jollof rice, although having Senegambian origin, has 
            become a culinary pride of Africa, especially in Ghana 
            and Nigeria, but also in countries like Liberia, 
            Cameroon and Sierra Leone. This has sparked a 
            gastro-nationalistic rivalry which finds its battlefield 
            mainly on social media over who makes the best Jollof, 
            and has made this intriguing rice dish a hallmark of 
            African cuisine. In this article we will focus on the 
            importance of Ghanaian jollof rice.

        <ul>
            <li>Rice</li>
            <li>Tomatoes Paste</li>
            <li>Vegetable Oil</li>
            <li>Goat Meat</li>
            <li>Vegetables</li>  
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps in Preparation</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Add onions and 2 tablespoons of oil to a blender and 
                pulse until smooth. Transfer to a medium bowl.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the diced tomatoes, tomato paste, and habanero 
                pepper to the blender, and pulse until smooth. 
                Transfer to a separate medium bowl.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat the remaining â…“ cup (80 ml) of oil in a large, 
                heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once the oil is shimmering, add the onion puree and 
                cook until the water has cooked out and the puree 
                is starting to brown, about 10 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stir in the tomato puree and add the curry powder, 
                garlic powder, ginger, dried herbs, and crushed 
                bouillon cubes. Cook for 20-30 minutes, stirring 
                occasionally, until the stew has reduced by half 
                and is deep red in color.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the rice, mixed vegetables, and water. Bring to 
                a boil, then reduce the heat to low and cover the 
                pot with foil and a lid. Simmer for another 30 
                minutes, until the rice is cooked through and the 
                liquid is absorbed.
            </li>
