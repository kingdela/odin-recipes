        <h2>
            Gob3: A legendary life saver
        </h2>

        <p>
            At the mention of the name red-red, one might think it’s 
            something else other than food. But it is actually one 
            of the best Ghana dishes. It’s simply a combination of 
            fried ripe plantain and beans sauce. This food is 
            enjoyed all over Ghana. It is not really a food 
            common only to a particular tribe or geographical area.
            Many like it for its balanced nutritional value and 
            keeping one full for a much longer time. It is simply 
            prepared by frying the ripe plantain and preparing a 
            beans sauce.

                To prepare the beans sauce, soak beans for some 
                hours or overnight in order to reduce cooking 
                time from 30 minutes to 15 minutes. Add enough 
                water to cover the beans in a saucepan and cook 
                until tender.
            </li>

                Then, slice onions and add Kpakposhito (pepper) 
                and fry in palm oil. Pour the beans into the 
                palm oil and simmer for 10 minutes. Serve it on 
                a plate and add the hot fried plantain. Some 
                choose to add gari, another local grain. 
                Food is ready!
